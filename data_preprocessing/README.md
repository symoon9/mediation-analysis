## Data Preprocessing
### Work Flow
1. Collect brain that has significant p values for each GPS
2. Do PCA
3. Transform the data
4. Plot PCA biplot in order to find biased data
5. If something is biased, separate the data
6. Conduct GLM to find significant relationship
7. If the significant relationship exits, you are ready to do Mediation Analysis!
